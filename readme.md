# appserver-templatev12

This repository allows to automate building an Odoo 12 appserver on Ubuntu 
and AWS Cloud9.

It installs:

* Python 3.7.x
* All ubuntu packages required to build the appsevrer

Note that due to incompatibility with Python 3 it no longer installs `collective.recipe.supervisor`.
